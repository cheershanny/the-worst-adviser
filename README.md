### 📄 Description
This project is a part of my JS learning and Git/GitHub practicing from ***CodeCademy's Mixed Message project***
Every time a user runs a program, they get a new, randomized advice.
### 🤙 How to use
This program is completely writen in JS. You need to have [Node](https://www.codecademy.com/article/setting-up-node-locally) on your local computer to run it.
### 🧰 Technologies
The data is stored in three separate arrays in the same file. 
There's only one built function to generate the end messages.
