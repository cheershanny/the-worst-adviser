#The worst adviser generator
===
##**Description**
    - This project is a part of my JS learning and Git/GitHub practicing from ***CodeCademy's Mixed Message project***
    - Every time a user runs a program, they get a new, randomized advice.
--- 
##**How to use**
    - This program is completely writen in JS. You need to have [Node](https://www.codecademy.com/article/setting-up-node-locally) on your local computer to run it.
---
##**Technologies**
    - The data is stored in three separate arrays in the same file. 
    - There's only one built function to generate the end messages.
